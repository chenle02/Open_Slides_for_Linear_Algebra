# Open slides for Linear Algebra
1. In this repo, we share the slides for the course "Math 221 -- Linear Algebra"
   in the Department of Mathematics, Emory University, taught by me in 2021
   Spring.
2. The slides were adapted from those by Professor [Karen Seyffarth](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/math/profiles/101-152971) from
   University of Calgary under the Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC-SA).
